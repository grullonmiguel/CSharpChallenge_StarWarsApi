# Challenge Star Wars Api Usage Challenge (SWAPI)

From the IAmTimCorey YouTube Series:

#  Goal
Create a Console app that will look up
people in the SWAPI (www.swapi.co)
based upon their ID number. Handle
missing IDs/errors and load all the data
for successful entries.

# Bonus

Cache requests in memory. If you call
the same call again, have it pull from the
cache instead of from the API. Also,
rename at least some of the properties
to C#-style names without breaking the
lookup.

# Implementation

Create a WPF/MVVM application instead of a 
console application
